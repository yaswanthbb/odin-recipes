        Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. Allrecipes is a
        community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate<br>
        the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a
        slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping<br>
        9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a
        decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack<br>
        spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night. Most
        importantly, Allrecipes connects home cooks with their greatest sources<br>
        of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital
        food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our<br>
        community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.
