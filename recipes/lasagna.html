    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      This is actually quite easy to make for someone who has never made lasagna
      before, according to jimbob2229. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese
      and added spinach. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again.

      I didn't have any ground pork in the house, so I omitted that ingredient,
      but it was great with just the beef, says one Allrecipes community member.
      The sauce came out terrific too, much better than the stuff you find in
      jars.

      <li class="">
        Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and
        crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir
        in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5
        teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until
        they're al dente.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the
        remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
        (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is
        assembled.
      </li>
      <li class="">
        Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for
        about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is
        golden brown.
